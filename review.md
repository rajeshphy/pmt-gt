Thank you for your insightful feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to
address and clarify the points raised in the review.

1.  **I would suggest the authors to include the reference Factorization
    method and new potentials with the oscillator spectrum, J. Math.
    Phys. 25, 3387-3389 (1984). Maybe they could also include a comment
    on page 3 of the role of the Riccati equation in how the knowledge
    of one factorization allow to obtain a one parameter family.**

    We express our gratitude for the valuable suggestion. We have
    incorporated the reference \"Factorization method and new potentials
    with the oscillator spectrum, J. Math. Phys. 25, 3387-3389 (1984)\"
    into our manuscript as Ref.$[1]$. Additionally, we have enhance the
    discussion on page 3 after Eq. (9), explaining the role of the
    Riccati equation and how it facilitates the derivation of a
    one-parameter family from a single factorization.

    The new line reads as\
    *The is a Riccati equation $[1,2]$ \...\...\... however their
    eigenfunctions are different*

    Further we have corrected one typo error in the section-\"REHO
    Potential\", page 5, first line below equation 17, where we have
    replaced $(-1)^m$ in the equation $\mathcal{H}_m(x)=(-1)^mH_m(ix)$
    by $(-i)^m$ and therefore the corrected equation reads
    $\mathcal{H}_m(x)=(-i)^mH_m(ix)$.

2.  **Maybe the authors could precise as well in which context they
    would like to consider in the conclusion. As for the deformed
    oscillator with m odd the Hamiltonian might not be regular.**

    We acknowledge the need for greater precision in the conclusion
    regarding the considered context. In particular, for odd
    codimensions ($m$), the potential takes the form
    $x^2+\frac{2}{x^2}-2+f(x)$. For any $m$, the first three terms are
    present and the $\frac{1}{x^2}$ term prohibits its regularity at the
    origin, and therefore, its solution cannot be in terms of Hermite
    polynomials as it does not vanish at the origin.

    The concern regarding the regularity of the Hamiltonian for odd
    codimension ($m$) has been duly noted. We will carefully examine
    this issue and consider alternative approaches to address any
    irregularities that may arise in our forthcoming project.

3.  **\"Can one similarly obtain the corresponding one parameter family
    of potentials in case the codimension m is odd.\"**

    For odd codimensions, exemplified by $m=1$ for which $f(x)=0$, and
    the regular solution for the same is
    $\Psi(x)=B\; x^{2}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}L_{n}^{\frac{3}{2}}(x^2)$. When
    $m\neq 1$ the function $f(x)\neq 0$ and the regular solution will be
    different from the above.

    Certainly, when $m=1$, the wavefunction exhibits symmetry about the
    origin attributed to the quadratic positional dependence ($x^2$). We
    suspect that this symmetry persists for any odd value of $m$, while
    for even values of $m$, such symmetry is notably absent. We suspect
    that one might get exceptional Laguerre polynomials for odd $m$
    cases. we plan to look at this issue carefully in our next project.

4.  **On the other hand with some modification such as considering the
    truncated oscillator as initial Hamiltonian such other codimension
    can be considered. Also other deformation related to exceptional
    Laguerre polynomials can allow wider type of codimension.**

    The Schr√∂dinger equation with $m=1$ highlights the wavefunction's
    reliance on generalized Laguerre polynomials. It also suggests a
    potential connection to exceptional Laguerre polynomials for odd
    values of $m$ greater than 1, similar to the association with
    exceptional Hermite polynomials for even values of $m$ greater than
    zero. Exploring truncated oscillator and exceptional Laguerre
    polynomials may broaden the considered codimensions. Therefore, in
    Summary and discussion section 6 (page no 17, second para), We
    replaced a line **"Can one similarly obtain the corresponding one
    parameter family of potentials in case the codimension m is odd."**
    with

    *"In particular, for odd codimensions (m)\...\...\...\.....will be
    explored in detailed in our forthcoming project".*

    In conclusion, odd codimensions hint at a reliance on exceptional
    Laguerre polynomials. This avenue will be explored in our
    forthcoming project, incorporating valuable feedback for refinement.
